Here are some algorithms and data structures that I would like to implement as
part of this repository:

```
associative array
binary search
binary tree
breadth first search
bubble sort
depth first search
hash table
heap
linked list
minimax
queue
quicksort
stack
string
```

## Usage

I don't plan on writing every algorithm in the same language or with the same
interface, so I won't make any attempt to provide unified instructions for how
to build and test each one, but in general it will be what you would expect.

E.g. for a C program it will be `make` to build, and `make test` to test, and
for a Golang program it will be `go build .` to build, and `go test .` to test
the algoritm.
